![Intro](https://github.com/PyanshuXd/Hotel_Management/blob/a0d9f648a1ba7daeb320444190d82382b5068865/Images%20Used/1st.jpeg)

## Description:
The Hotel Management System is a database-driven solution designed to streamline hotel operations, enhancing efficiency and guest satisfaction. Built using MySQL, this system centralizes key functions such as guest reservations, room management, billing, and staff coordination into a single, user-friendly platform.
The system allows hotels to manage bookings in real-time, track room availability, automate invoices, and maintain guest records securely. Staff can efficiently handle check-ins/check-outs, assign rooms, and generate reports on occupancy and revenue. Administrators have controlled access to oversee operations, update pricing, and manage employee roles.

## Problem Statement:
- Manual inefficiencies: Traditional hotel operations rely on paper-based records, leading to slow check-ins/check-outs and booking errors.
- Overbooking risks: Without real-time room tracking, double bookings occur, causing customer dissatisfaction.
- Billing errors: Handwritten invoices and payment calculations are prone to mistakes, leading to revenue loss.
- Poor data management: Disorganized guest histories, staff records, and inventory make reporting and decision-making difficult.
- Security concerns: Unauthorized access to sensitive guest and financial data due to lack of a secure system.

## Objectives:
- Replace manual processes with a digital system for booking, check-ins, check-outs, and billing to improve efficiency.
- Implement real-time room availability tracking to eliminate double bookings and optimize occupancy.
- Automate invoice generation, payment tracking, and receipt management to reduce human errors.
